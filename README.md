# Term3D

A lightweight 3D graphics engine built with C++ and OpenGL, designed for real-time rendering and geometric transformations.

## Overview

Term3D is a minimalist 3D rendering framework that provides core functionality for creating and manipulating 3D meshes with matrix transformations. It features a clean API for building interactive 3D applications.

## Features

- **Core 3D Mathematics**: Vector2/3/4, Matrix3/4 with full transformation support
- **Geometric Primitives**: Cube, Sphere, and Plane mesh generation
- **Real-time Rendering**: OpenGL-based renderer with modern shader pipeline
- **Transform System**: Translation, rotation, scaling, and matrix chaining
- **Mesh Management**: Dynamic mesh creation and modification
- **Bounding Box**: Collision detection support

> The library was made for siege during my exam week and is not worked on much and is not ready for any real use. As it has very limited features and documentation.
